***I'm the kid who some people used to dislike because I had good grades, was good at sports, drawing and playing the piano and wasn't physically ungracefull.***

I would say that I'm what some people call a "*perfect kid*".

Well, ***I'm not that kid anymore cause everything changed when I got to university***, but in the essence, that's who I am. BTW, I'm 21 now, and to me the term kid applies from 8 to 17 years old.

I remember the old days in school, not that far ago, when ***I would get bored in class*** because the teacher had to repeat everything three times and still some woudn't get it. I remember listening to others conversations and ***thinking that I was wasting my time***. I could have been more socially active, but I didn't need to.

I remember that ***I wanted to be an astronaut***.

I remember that I had a love/hate relation with religion lessons. I went to a catholic school and I didn't believe in god. I always admired those who do, and I was the first person to like the ones that really felt that way in my class, but I didn't.

***I would often argue with the teacher about a lot of things***. I didn't want to psycologically attack them when I argueued, but most teachers felt that way. As a consequence, I never had very good grades in "attitude" (in my school there was 2 grades for each subject, the grades you actually got from exams and what they called attitude, wich was also part of the total grade and solely based on a subjective thing, what your teacher thought about the way you behaved in class).

I remember that every year there was a day when all the students from school had the opportunity to play an instrument or sing in front of the others. I always played the piano and ***once even played ["Piano Man"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxEPV4kolz0) by Billy Joel, with the piano and harmonica at the same time***. It's less complicated than what it sounds like, trust me on this one.

Oh, and ***I also loved skateboarding***. I would spend hours everyday skating until I once broke my right knee. I then stopped skateboarding and switched to surfing. I felt it was way less risky but still gave me the freedom to move fast and do some sport.

After school, because I had good grades, ***I got accepted for studying Aerospace Engineering.*** This apparently small thing changed absolutely everything.
