Hi! My name is Daniel Carmona, I'm 21 and I'm an undergraduate Aerospace Engineer, but most importantly, I'm a person who has been running different businesses for about 4 years and I have a lot of anecdotes to share.

I will start this blog from the beginning, telling you a bit about my past, but this will be a short blog entry as what I really want to focus on is my experiences since I founded my first company.

I hope you enjoy this and please reach me via [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you want to tell me something, I will answer every single email I receive.

I'm the tall guy with crazy hair.
